# Problem: AI-Driven Marketing
This task is composed of three sub-tasks, each focusing on different aspects of AI-driven marketing.

### a) Basic Automation for Engagement

- Your goal is to implement automation for sending personalized emails on special occasions such as birthdays and Valentineâ€™s Day.
- Analyze customer data to understand preferences such as favorite items, spending patterns (Premium, Standard, Economy), top order sources (Online, POS, DoorDash), and specific preferences (e.g., chicken, beef etc.) along with customer activity times (Morning, Evening, Mid-day) or customer profiling.

### b) Personalized Marketing Campaigns
- Utilize insights from the analysis did in task 1 to craft personalized marketing messages. This includes personalized emails, SMS, app banners, social media captions and targeted ads to specific customer clusters (e.g. Spenders, chicken lover etc.).
- Personalization should leverage data on customer favorites, birthdays, preferred times, spending patterns, and order sources to create highly targeted and relevant marketing campaigns. Make sure to include personalized deals.

### c) Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction

- To predict customer churn, segment customers into four categories: 
    1. New
    2. Occasional
    3. Regular
    4. Lost
- Design and implement retention strategies using personalized marketing campaigns tailored to each customer segment, aiming to minimize churn and enhance customer engagement.
